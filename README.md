# China-s-Optimization-of-Industrial-Structure-and-Energy-Mix
This repository provides a multi-objective optimization code for China's industrial structure and energy mix from 2021 to 2060. Its core objective is to maximize long-term economic growth while minimizing carbon emissions and air pollution. 
The .py file contains the modeling and solving code for the optimization model.
All .xlsx files contain the parameters required by the model. These include base-year data such as input-output tables and the energy mix, as well as projections for future technological parameters like energy intensity and pollution emission intensity. The file paths within the code can be replaced with local paths on your machine when running the program.
